-- Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a

-- 		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
-- 		match using |matchdelete()|.
-- 		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
-- 		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
-- 		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.
-- 		The "Conceal" value is special, it causes the match to be
-- 		concealed.
--
-- 		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
-- 		match.  A match with a high priority will have its
-- 		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
-- 		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
-- 		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
-- 		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
-- 		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
-- 		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
-- 		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
-- 		always overrule syntax highlighting.
--
-- 		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
-- 		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
-- 		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
-- 		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
-- 		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
-- 		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified or -1,
-- 		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.
--
-- 		The optional {dict} argument allows for further custom
-- 		values. Currently this is used to specify a match specific
-- 		conceal character that will be shown for |hl-Conceal|
-- 		highlighted matches. The dict can have the following members:
--
-- 			conceal	    Special character to show instead of the
-- 				    match (only for |hl-Conceal| highlighed
-- 				    matches, see |:syn-cchar|)
-- 			window	    Instead of the current window use the
-- 				    window with this number or window ID.
--
-- 		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
-- 		the |:match| commands.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
-- 			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
-- <		Deletion of the pattern: >
-- 			:call matchdelete(m)

-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the

-- 				position in the undo tree, the block that will
-- 				be used by a redo command.  When nothing was
-- 				undone after the last change this item will
-- 				not appear anywhere.
-- 		  "save"	Only appears on the last block before a file
-- 				write.  The number is the write count.  The
-- 				first write has number 1, the last one the
-- 				"save_last" mentioned above.
-- 		  "alt"		Alternate entry.  This is again a List of undo
-- 				blocks.  Each item may again have an "alt"
-- 				item.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.undotree() end

-- If {arg} is not specified, then information about all the tab
-- 		pages is returned as a List. Each List item is a Dictionary.
-- 		Otherwise, {arg} specifies the tab page number and information
-- 		about that one is returned.  If the tab page does not exist an
-- 		empty List is returned.
--
-- 		Each List item is a Dictionary with the following entries:
-- 			tabnr		tab page number.
-- 			variables	a reference to the dictionary with
-- 					tabpage-local variables
-- 			windows		List of |window-ID|s in the tab page.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.gettabinfo(expr) end

-- Just like |finddir()|, but find a file instead of a directory.
-- 		Uses 'suffixesadd'.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo findfile("tags.vim", ".;")
-- <		Searches from the directory of the current file upwards until
-- 		it finds the file "tags.vim".
--- @return string
function vim.fn.findfile(name, path, count) end

-- Bitwise invert.  The argument is converted to a number.  A
-- 		List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.  Example: >
-- 			:let bits = invert(bits)
--- @return number
function vim.fn.invert(expr) end

-- window.  The top window has number 1.
--
-- 		The optional argument {arg} supports the following values:
-- 			$	the number of the last window (the window
-- 				count).
-- 			#	the number of the last accessed window (where
-- 				|CTRL-W_p| goes to).  If there is no previous
-- 				window or it is in another tab page 0 is
-- 				returned.
-- 			{N}j	the number of the Nth window below the
-- 				current window (where |CTRL-W_j| goes to).
-- 			{N}k	the number of the Nth window above the current
-- 				window (where |CTRL-W_k| goes to).
-- 			{N}h	the number of the Nth window left of the
-- 				current window (where |CTRL-W_h| goes to).
-- 			{N}l	the number of the Nth window right of the
-- 				current window (where |CTRL-W_l| goes to).
-- 		The number can be used with |CTRL-W_w| and ":wincmd w"
-- 		|:wincmd|.
-- 		Also see |tabpagewinnr()| and |win_getid()|.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			let window_count = winnr('$')
-- 			let prev_window = winnr('#')
-- 			let wnum = winnr('3k')
-- <
--- @return number
function vim.fn.winnr(expr) end

-- Like |append()| but append the text in buffer {expr}.
--
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()|.
--
-- 		{lnum} is used like with |append()|.  Note that using |line()|
-- 		would use the current buffer, not the one appending to.
-- 		Use "$" to append at the end of the buffer.
--
-- 		On success 0 is returned, on failure 1 is returned.
--
-- 		If {expr} is not a valid buffer or {lnum} is not valid, an
-- 		error message is given. Example: >
-- 			:let failed = appendbufline(13, 0, "# THE START")
-- <
--- @return number
function vim.fn.appendbufline(expr, lnum, text) end

-- The result is a copy of the {src} string with all characters
-- 		which appear in {fromstr} replaced by the character in that
-- 		position in the {tostr} string.  Thus the first character in
-- 		{fromstr} is translated into the first character in {tostr}
-- 		and so on.  Exactly like the unix "tr" command.
-- 		This code also deals with multibyte characters properly.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo tr("hello there", "ht", "HT")
-- <		returns "Hello THere" >
-- 			echo tr("<blob>", "<>", "{}")
-- <		returns "{blob}"
--- @return string
function vim.fn.tr(src, fromstr, tostr) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the |window-ID| of the first
-- 		window associated with buffer {expr}.  For the use of {expr},
-- 		see |bufname()| above.  If buffer {expr} doesn't exist or
-- 		there is no such window, -1 is returned.  Example: >
--
-- 	echo "A window containing buffer 1 is " . (bufwinid(1))
-- <
-- 		Only deals with the current tab page.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.bufwinid(expr) end

-- Returns non-zero when the popup menu is visible, zero
-- 		otherwise.  See |ins-completion-menu|.
-- 		This can be used to avoid some things that would remove the
-- 		popup menu.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.pumvisible() end

-- Return a string which contains characters indicating the
-- 		current state.  Mostly useful in callbacks that want to do
-- 		work that may not always be safe.  Roughly this works like:
-- 		- callback uses state() to check if work is safe to do.
-- 		  Yes: then do it right away.
-- 		  No:  add to work queue and add a |SafeState| and/or
-- 		       |SafeStateAgain| autocommand (|SafeState| triggers at
-- 		       toplevel, |SafeStateAgain| triggers after handling
-- 		       messages and callbacks).
-- 		- When SafeState or SafeStateAgain is triggered and executes
-- 		  your autocommand, check with `state()` if the work can be
-- 		  done now, and if yes remove it from the queue and execute.
-- 		  Remove the autocommand if the queue is now empty.
-- 		Also see |mode()|.
--
-- 		When {what} is given only characters in this string will be
-- 		added.  E.g, this checks if the screen has scrolled: >
-- 			if state('s') == ''
-- 			   " screen has not scrolled
-- <
-- 		These characters indicate the state, generally indicating that
-- 		something is busy:
-- 		    m	halfway a mapping, :normal command, feedkeys() or
-- 			stuffed command
-- 		    o	operator pending or waiting for a command argument,
-- 		        e.g. after |f|
-- 		    a	Insert mode autocomplete active
-- 		    x	executing an autocommand
-- 		    w	blocked on waiting, e.g. ch_evalexpr(), ch_read() and
-- 			ch_readraw() when reading json.
-- 		    S	not triggering SafeState or SafeStateAgain
-- 		    c	callback invoked, including timer (repeats for
-- 			recursiveness up to "ccc")
-- 		    s	screen has scrolled for messages
--- @return string
function vim.fn.state(what) end
