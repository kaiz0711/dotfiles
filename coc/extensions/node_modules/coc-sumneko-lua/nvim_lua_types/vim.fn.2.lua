-- 		'f'	All the quickfix lists in the quickfix stack are
-- 			freed.
--
-- 		If {action} is not present or is set to ' ', then a new list

-- 		    efm		errorformat to use when parsing text from
-- 				"lines". If this is not present, then the
-- 				'errorformat' option value is used.
-- 		    id		quickfix list identifier |quickfix-ID|
-- 		    items	list of quickfix entries. Same as the {list}
-- 				argument.
-- 		    lines	use 'errorformat' to parse a list of lines and
-- 				add the resulting entries to the quickfix list
-- 				{nr} or {id}.  Only a |List| value is supported.
-- 		    nr		list number in the quickfix stack; zero
-- 				means the current quickfix list and "$" means
-- 				the last quickfix list
-- 		    title	quickfix list title text
-- 		Unsupported keys in {what} are ignored.
-- 		If the "nr" item is not present, then the current quickfix list
-- 		is modified. When creating a new quickfix list, "nr" can be
-- 		set to a value one greater than the quickfix stack size.
-- 		When modifying a quickfix list, to guarantee that the correct
-- 		list is modified, "id" should be used instead of "nr" to
-- 		specify the list.
--
-- 		Examples (See also |setqflist-examples|): >

--
-- 		Note that the job object will be deleted if there are no

-- 		Use |chansend()| to send data to stdout, and

-- Stop the {job}.  This can also be used to signal the job.
--
-- 		When {how} is omitted or is "term" the job will be terminated.
-- 		For Unix SIGTERM is sent.  On MS-Windows the job will be
-- 		terminated forcedly (there is no "gentle" way).
-- 		This goes to the process group, thus children may also be
-- 		affected.
--
-- 		Effect for Unix:
-- 			"term"	 SIGTERM (default)
-- 			"hup"	 SIGHUP
-- 			"quit"	 SIGQUIT
-- 			"int"	 SIGINT
-- 			"kill"	 SIGKILL (strongest way to stop)
-- 			number	 signal with that number
--
-- 		Effect for MS-Windows:
-- 			"term"	 terminate process forcedly (default)
-- 			"hup"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"quit"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"int"	 CTRL_C
-- 			"kill"	 terminate process forcedly
-- 			Others	 CTRL_BREAK
--
-- 		On Unix the signal is sent to the process group.  This means
-- 		that when the job is "sh -c command" it affects both the shell
-- 		and the command.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 if the operation could be executed,
-- 		0 if "how" is not supported on the system.
-- 		Note that even when the operation was executed, whether the
-- 		job was actually stopped needs to be checked with
-- 		|job_status()|.
--
-- 		If the status of the job is "dead", the signal will not be
-- 		sent.  This is to avoid to stop the wrong job (esp. on Unix,
-- 		where process numbers are recycled).
--
-- 		When using "kill" Vim will assume the job will die and close
-- 		the channel.

-- This is similar to |json_encode()| with these differences:

-- 		For example, the Vim object:
-- 			[1,v:none,{"one":1},v:none] ~
-- 		Will be encoded as:
-- 			[1,,{one:1},,] ~

-- Same as |matchadd()|, but requires a list of positions {pos}
-- 		instead of a pattern. This command is faster than |matchadd()|
-- 		because it does not require to handle regular expressions and
-- 		sets buffer line boundaries to redraw screen. It is supposed
-- 		to be used when fast match additions and deletions are
-- 		required, for example to highlight matching parentheses.

-- 		The list {pos} can contain one of these items:
-- 		- A number.  This whole line will be highlighted.  The first
-- 		  line has number 1.
-- 		- A list with one number, e.g., [23]. The whole line with this
-- 		  number will be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with two numbers, e.g., [23, 11]. The first number is
-- 		  the line number, the second one is the column number (first
-- 		  column is 1, the value must correspond to the byte index as
-- 		  |col()| would return).  The character at this position will
-- 		  be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with three numbers, e.g., [23, 11, 3]. As above, but
-- 		  the third number gives the length of the highlight in bytes.
--
-- 		Entries with zero and negative line numbers are silently
-- 		ignored, as well as entries with negative column numbers and

-- Add a callback function that will be invoked when changes have
-- 		been made to buffer {buf}.
-- 		{buf} refers to a buffer name or number. For the accepted
-- 		values, see |bufname()|.  When {buf} is omitted the current
-- 		buffer is used.
-- 		Returns a unique ID that can be passed to |listener_remove()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with five arguments:
-- 		    a:bufnr	the buffer that was changed
-- 		    a:start	first changed line number
-- 		    a:end	first line number below the change
-- 		    a:added	number of lines added, negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    a:changes	a List of items with details about the changes
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 	    func Listener(bufnr, start, end, added, changes)
-- 	      echo 'lines ' .. a:start .. ' until ' .. a:end .. ' changed'
-- 	    endfunc
-- 	    call listener_add('Listener', bufnr)
--
-- <		The List cannot be changed.  Each item in a:changes is a
-- 		dictionary with these entries:
-- 		    lnum	the first line number of the change
-- 		    end		the first line below the change
-- 		    added	number of lines added; negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    col		first column in "lnum" that was affected by
-- 				the change; one if unknown or the whole line
-- 				was affected; this is a byte index, first
-- 				character has a value of one.
-- 		When lines are inserted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	line above which the new line is added
-- 		    end		equal to "lnum"
-- 		    added	number of lines inserted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are deleted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	the first deleted line
-- 		    end		the line below the first deleted line, before
-- 				the deletion was done
-- 		    added	negative, number of lines deleted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are changed:
-- 		    lnum	the first changed line
-- 		    end		the line below the last changed line
-- 		    added	0
-- 		    col		first column with a change or 1
--
-- 		The entries are in the order the changes were made, thus the
-- 		most recent change is at the end.  The line numbers are valid
-- 		when the callback is invoked, but later changes may make them
-- 		invalid, thus keeping a copy for later might not work.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked just before the screen is updated,
-- 		when |listener_flush()| is called or when a change is being
-- 		made that changes the line count in a way it causes a line
-- 		number in the list of changes to become invalid.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with the text locked, see
-- 		|textlock|.  If you do need to make changes to the buffer, use
-- 		a timer to do this later |timer_start()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is not invoked when the buffer is first loaded.
-- 		Use the |BufReadPost| autocmd event to handle the initial text
-- 		of a buffer.
-- 		The {callback} is also not invoked when the buffer is
-- 		unloaded, use the |BufUnload| autocmd event for that.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|, the base is passed as the
-- 		second argument: >
-- 			GetBuffer()->listener_add(callback)
--- @return number

-- 		Call nvim |api| functions. The type checking of arguments will
-- 		be stricter than for most other builtins. For instance,
-- 		if Integer is expected, a |Number| must be passed in, a
-- 		|String| will not be autoconverted.
-- 		Buffer numbers, as returned by |bufnr()| could be used as
-- 		first argument to nvim_buf_... functions.  All functions
-- 		expecting an object (buffer, window or tabpage) can
-- 		also take the numerical value 0 to indicate the current
-- 		(focused) object.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.nr2char(expr, utf8) end

-- Return the number of times an item with value {expr} appears
-- 		in |String|, |List| or |Dictionary| {comp}.
--
-- 		If {start} is given then start with the item with this index.
-- 		{start} can only be used with a |List|.
--
-- 		When {ic} is given and it's |TRUE| then case is ignored.
--
-- 		When {comp} is a string then the number of not overlapping
-- 		occurrences of {expr} is returned. Zero is returned when
-- 		{expr} is an empty string.
--- @param list any[]
--- @return number
function vim.fn.count(list, expr, ic, start) end

-- Filter that can be used for a popup. These keys can be used:
-- 		    j <Down>		select item below
-- 		    k <Up>		select item above
-- 		    <Space> <Enter>	accept current selection
-- 		    x Esc CTRL-C	cancel the menu
-- 		Other keys are ignored.
--
-- 		A match is set on that line to highlight it, see
-- 		|popup_menu()|.
--
-- 		When the current selection is accepted the "callback" of the
-- 		popup menu is invoked with the index of the selected line as
-- 		the second argument.  The first entry has index one.
-- 		Cancelling the menu invokes the callback with -1.
--
-- 		To add shortcut keys, see the example here:
-- 		|popup_menu-shortcut-example|
--- @return number
function vim.fn.popup_filter_menu(id, key) end

-- Same as |match()|, but return a |List|.  The first item in the
-- 		list is the matched string, same as what matchstr() would
-- 		return.  Following items are submatches, like "\1", "\2", etc.
-- 		in |:substitute|.  When an optional submatch didn't match an
-- 		empty string is used.  Example: >
-- 			echo matchlist('acd', '\(a\)\?\(b\)\?\(c\)\?\(.*\)')
-- <		Results in: ['acd', 'a', '', 'c', 'd', '', '', '', '', '']
-- 		When there is no match an empty list is returned.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.matchlist(expr, pat, start, count) end

-- Filter that can be used for a popup. It handles only the keys
-- 		'y', 'Y' and 'n' or 'N'.  Invokes the "callback" of the
-- 		popup menu with the 1 for 'y' or 'Y' and zero for 'n' or 'N'
-- 		as the second argument.  Pressing Esc and 'x' works like
-- 		pressing 'n'.  CTRL-C invokes the callback with -1.  Other
-- 		keys are ignored.
-- 		See the example here: |popup_dialog-example|
--- @return number
function vim.fn.popup_filter_yesno(id, key) end

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they
-- 		come from a mapping or were typed by the user.
--
-- 		By default the string is added to the end of the typeahead
-- 		buffer, thus if a mapping is still being executed the
-- 		characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
-- 		other characters, they will be executed next, before any
-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
-- 		{string}.
--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.
--
-- 		Return value is always 0.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.feedkeys(string, mode) end
