-- 	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one

-- 	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
-- 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
-- 		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
-- 		that can't be converted.
-- 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
-- 	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
-- 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
-- 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
-- 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
-- 		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
-- 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
-- <	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
-- 	non-blank characters.
-- 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
-- 	not used.
-- 	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
-- 	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
-- 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
-- <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
-- 	an empty file.
-- 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
-- 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
-- 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
-- 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
-- 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
-- 	accepted.
-- 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
-- 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
-- 	encoding, such as Russian.
-- 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
-- 	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
-- 	illegal byte sequence.

-- 	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
-- 	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
-- 	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
-- 	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
-- 	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",

-- 	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
-- 	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
-- 	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
-- 	  3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
-- 	     if 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
-- 	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
-- 	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
-- 	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.

-- 	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
-- 	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
-- 	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
-- 	     'fileformats' is used.
-- 	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but

-- 	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language

-- 	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
-- 	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
-- 	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
-- 	This is the opposite of the 'keymap' option, where characters are
-- 	mapped in Insert mode.
-- 	Also consider resetting 'langremap' to avoid 'langmap' applies to

-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
